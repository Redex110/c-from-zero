# C From Zero

C From Zero is a structured learning repository created to practice and understand
the C programming language from the ground up.

This repository contains small, focused programs organized by topic, covering
core C concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, arrays, pointers,
structures, and file handling.

## Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in C
- Practice clean and readable code
- Maintain a clear learning history using Git
- Grow from basic syntax to real-world programs

## Structure
Each folder represents a core topic in C, and each program focuses on a single concept.

## Tools
- Language: C
- Compiler: GCC/Clang
- Editor: Nano / VS Code
- OS: Ubuntu 25.10

## Progress
This repository is updated regularly as I continue learning and practicing C.
